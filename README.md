# CS423-Rule-110
## Author: Ryan Matthews
## Description:
### This software creates and outputs an ASCII rendering of the Rule 10 Elementary Cellular Automaton, which creates a new row of bits from the previous row based on a specified combination. It uses an initial array to start the process.
## Instructions for Building and Running:
### cargo build
### cargo run
## Issue Comments:
### The only main issue i had was how to go about constructing the main function to process an array into a Rule110 combination, but then realized a match-case system would work fine
## Miscellaneous Comments:
### No Miscellaneous Comments as this is the first project.
